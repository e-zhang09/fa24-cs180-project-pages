<h1>Project 3: Face Morphing</h1>
<b>By Ethan Zhang</b>

<h2>Overview</h2>
In order to morph two faces together, I manually defined correspondences between the two faces. Then, a Delaunay
triangulation can be applied on the average points between the pair of correspondences. With the triangulation in hand,
it is possible to calculate the forward / backward affine transformation matrices between triangulations in the average
shape and each of the source images. With these matrices, it is already possible to do forward warping.
However, I decided to use backward warping which allows for seamless reconstruction of the final
image. More specifically, I am able to apply the inverse affine transformation matrix on coordinate points within each
triangulation then use a ratio to merge the resulting source colors.

<h2>Part 1. Defining Correspondences</h2>

In order to define correspondences on the image, I first coded a rudimentary tool with <code>ginput</code> that worked
decently well.

<table class="extra-height">
    <tr style="vertical-align: top">
        <td>
            <figure>
                <img src='images/p1/2.png' />
                <figcaption>Picker</figcaption>
            </figure>
        </td>
        <td>
            <figure>
                <img src='images/p1/1.png' />
                <figcaption>Result on Ethan</figcaption>
            </figure>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

However, once I began to select a lot more correspondences to produce better morphs, it became quickly apparent that
it was very hard to keep track of the order at which I clicked. This is when I decided to use an online tool made by a
previous student: <a href="https://cal-cs180.github.io/fa23/hw/proj3/tool.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://cal-cs180.github.io/fa23/hw/proj3/tool.html</a>

<table class="extra-height">
    <tr style="vertical-align: top">
        <td>
            <figure>
                <img src='images/p1/3.png' />
                <figcaption>Result on Ethan</figcaption>
            </figure>
        </td>
        <td>
            <figure>
                <img src='images/p1/4.png' />
                <figcaption>Result on Royce</figcaption>
            </figure>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

The above figure also shows the Delaunay triangulation being computed on the correspondence points. I also found that
automatically adding correspondences for the corner of the image also yielded better morphing around the edges of the face.

<h2>Part 2. Computing the "Mid-way Face"</h2>

Using the high level process described in the overview, I computed the mid-way face between my friend and I.
Specifically, I used a warping and dissolving factor of 0.5 to have half way shape and colors from both of the input faces.
Although I ran into a lot of issues with the column vs row storage of the points, I eventually decided to stick with
the lecture format and calculated the affine matrix with the points stacked horizontally. Then, the transformation matrix
was applied on all the points in each triangulation that was generated with <code>ski.draw.polygon</code>.

<table>
    <tr style="vertical-align: top">
        <td>
            <figure>
                <img src='images/p2/ethan.jpg' />
                <figcaption>Input 1</figcaption>
            </figure>
        </td>
        <td>
            <figure>
                <img src='images/p2/1.png' />
                <figcaption>Morph</figcaption>
            </figure>
        </td>
        <td>
            <figure>
                <img src='images/p2/royce.jpg' />
                <figcaption>Input 2</figcaption>
            </figure>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h2>Part 3. The Morph Sequence</h2>

By re-using the code from the previous part and parameterizing the dissolve and warp fractions, I was also able to generate
an image sequence that represents the intermediate progress between the Ethan geometry (& colors) and that of Royce's.

<figure>
    <img src='images/p3/morph-sequence.gif'/>
    <figcaption>Ethan -> Royce</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2>Part 4. The "Mean face" of a population</h2>

After downloading the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210305094647/http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/~aam/datasets/datasets.html">Danes</a> dataset,
I was able to merge all of the pre-annotated correspondences into an average shape. This average shape was then used to morph
all of the faces in the dataset into the same average shape to generate an average face of the population.

<figure>
    <img src='images/p4/1.png'/>
    <figcaption>Average face of Danes</figcaption>
</figure>

Then, to test how my face would warp into the average geometry of the Danes population, I found the same correspondences
on my own face with the previously mentioned online labeling tool. Additionally, I tried to morph the average of the
Danes population into my facial geometry.

<table class="extra-height">
    <tr style="vertical-align: top">
        <td>
            <figure>
                <img src='images/p4/img.png' />
                <figcaption>Online Labeling Tool</figcaption>
            </figure>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<table class="extra-height">
    <tr style="vertical-align: top">
        <td>
            <figure>
                <img src='images/p4/2.png' />
                <figcaption>Ethan morphed into Danes</figcaption>
            </figure>
        </td>
        <td>
            <figure>
                <img src='images/p4/3.png' />
                <figcaption>Danes morphed into Ethan</figcaption>
            </figure>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h2>Part 5. Caricatures: Extrapolating from the mean</h2>

By deviating from the average shape of the Danes, I was able to create a caricature of my face:

<table class="extra-height">
    <tr style="vertical-align: top">
        <td>
            <figure>
                <img src='images/p4/2.png' />
                <figcaption>Ethan morphed into Danes</figcaption>
            </figure>
        </td>
        <td>
            <figure>
                <img src='images/p5/1.png' />
                <figcaption>Ethan morphed slightly</figcaption>
            </figure>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

Specifically, I used an alpha of 0.75 when adding back the delta X.
