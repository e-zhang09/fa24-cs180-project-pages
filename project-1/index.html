<h1>Project 1: Colorizing the Prokudin-Gorskii photo collection</h1>
<b>By Ethan Zhang</b>

<h2>Overview</h2>
In order to colorize the Prokudin-Gorskii photo collection, the main task is to align the 3 color channels then overlay
them to create a final image.
<br><br>
To approach this problem, I mainly iterated through different alignment options and optimizations until I reached
visually satisfactory results. In particular, I used NCC (Normalized Cross-Correlation) for similarity checking,
Canny Edge Feature for better matching, and a Gaussian filter to weigh the center of the image more significantly.
<br><br>
Here is an overview of the progression:
<table>
    <tr style="vertical-align: top">
        <td><img src="images/monastery-progression/monastery.jpg"/></td>
        <td><img src="images/monastery-progression/monastery-original.jpg" alt="Image 1">
            <div class="description">monastery.jpg (naive)</div></td>
        <td><img src="images/monastery-progression/monastery-canny.jpg" alt="Image 2">
            <div class="description">monastery.jpg (canny)</div></td>
        <td><img src="images/monastery-progression/monastery-canny-gaussian.jpg" alt="Image 2">
            <div class="description">monastery.jpg (canny + gaussian)</div></td>
    </tr>
</table>
<table>
    <tr style="vertical-align: top">
        <td><img src="images/emir-progression/emir%20Medium.jpeg"/></td>
        <td><img src="images/emir-progression/emir-original.jpg" alt="Image 4">
            <div class="description">emir.jpg (naive)</div></td>
        <td><img src="images/emir-progression/emir-canny.jpg" alt="Image 4">
            <div class="description">emir.jpg (canny)</div></td>
        <td><img src="images/emir-progression/emir-gaussian.jpg" alt="Image 4">
            <div class="description">emir.jpg (canny + gaussian)</div></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h2>Single-Scaled Approach</h2>

For the single-scaled approach, I took the most modest approach of exhaustively searching over a 15x15 window of
displacements for both the red and green channels against the blue channel. For each displacement, I chose to use
Normalized Cross-Correlation (NCC) as the score but it seemed like the normal euclidean distance formula worked equally
as well. At this point, I also realized that I could run the normalization process once before the 15x15 window
iterations since normalization doesn't depend on the order of elements--this seemed to reduce the running time a little
but I figured the majority probably came from the dot product.
<br><br>
It seemed to work pretty well in the case of <code>cathedral.jpg</code> and <code>tobolsk.jpg</code> where a 15x15
displacement search window seemed small enough to cover a large portion of the margins. In addition, a few pixels off
also did not seem to affect image quality. However, for the larger tif pictures, it seemed like there was no effect
at all.
<br>
<table>
    <tr style="vertical-align: top">
        <td><img src="images/single-scaled/cathedral.jpg"/>
            <div class="description">cathedral.jpg<br>Displacements:<br>[ 1 -1] [ 7 -1]</div></td>
        <td><img src="images/single-scaled/tobolsk.jpg"/>
            <div class="description">tobolsk.jpg<br>Displacements<br>[3 2] [6 3]</div></td>
    </tr>
</table>
<br>

<h2>Image Pyramid Approach</h2>

Having noticed that larger image files probably needed a larger window to search, I began implementing the Image
Pyramid approach. In this case, the idea is that we can artificially downscale the image channels such that we can
progressively get closer to where the displacement should actually be at by restoring the resolution, level by level,
whilst using previously discovered displacements. At this point, I also realized that it wasn't so necessary to run the
pyramid at higher level since it would essentially downscale it to a few pixels or produce very high displacements
(since it just rolled the image back to the origin).

<br><br>
Following this implementation, I had already find several images to align pretty well. For example,
<code>church.tif</code>, <code>icon.tif</code>, and <code>sculpture.tif</code> all looked well aligned:
<br>

<table>
    <tr style="vertical-align: top">
        <td><img src="images/image-pyramid/church.jpg"/>
            <div class="description">church.jpg<br>Displacements:<br>[0 -5] [52 -6]</div></td>
        <td><img src="images/image-pyramid/icon.jpg"/>
            <div class="description">icon.jpg<br>Displacements<br>[42 16] [89 22]</div></td>
        <td><img src="images/image-pyramid/sculpture.jpg"/>
            <div class="description">sculpture.jpg<br>Displacements<br>[ 33 -11] [140 -26]</div></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<br>
However, there were also a few that stood out like <code>emir.tif</code> and <code>harvesters.tif</code>:
<br>

<table>
    <tr style="vertical-align: top">
        <td><img src="images/image-pyramid/emir.jpg"/>
            <div class="description">emir.jpg<br>Displacements:<br>[-3  7] [107  17]</div></td>
        <td><img src="images/image-pyramid/harvesters.jpg"/>
            <div class="description">harvesters.jpg<br>Displacements<br>[118  -3] [257  -2]</div></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<br>
For <code>emir.tif</code> I had a guess that the misalignment probably came from the largely solid blue-ish clothing.
Since that would saturate the blue channel around that region, it probably had a high correlation coefficient with
all the other channel at many displacements. In addition, I had a feeling that it could also be caused by the image
borders.
<br><br>
Similarly for <code>harvesters.tif</code>, there were a lot of similar shapes in terms of the greenery and the people
wore similar color clothing which meant it was very easy for there to be close matches even though the displacement
might be significantly off from the actual displacement.
<br><br>
In order to resolve these issues, I felt that it might be better to try and correlate things that would be consistent
across the color channels. In particular, I looked into finding edges in an image since I reasoned that it would likely
remain consistent throughout the colors.

<h2>Bells & Whistles (Better Feature, Edge Detection)</h2>

At this point, I have discovered the Canny edge detector which was conveniently built into Scikit image. Since it also
generates a np array that represents an image for the specific channel, it was relatively simple to run the exact same
correlation / Image Pyramid algorithms devised in the previous steps. However, it didn't end up being as effective as I
first imagined. Although images like <code>emir.tif</code> and <code>harvesters.tif</code> had dramatically improved
alignment, some basic images like <code>cathedral.jpg</code> and <code>monastery.jpg</code> had a large regression.
<br>
<table>
    <tr style="vertical-align: top">
        <td><img src="images/canny/emir.jpg"/>
            <div class="description">emir.jpg<br>Displacements:<br>[49 23] [107  40]</div></td>
        <td><img src="images/canny/harvesters.jpg"/>
            <div class="description">harvesters.jpg<br>Displacements<br>[60 18] [123  10]</div></td>
    </tr>
</table>
<table>
    <tr style="vertical-align: top">
        <td><img src="images/canny/cathedral.jpg"/>
            <div class="description">cathedral.jpg<br>Displacements:<br>[-175 -151] [-180   -1]</div></td>
        <td><img src="images/canny/monastery.jpg"/>
            <div class="description">monastery.jpg<br>Displacements<br>[-76   0] [-82   1]</div></td>
    </tr>
</table>
<br>
In order to debug why this alignment was happening, I thought it might be helpful to print out the actual channels that
were being compared:
<br>
<table>
    <tr style="vertical-align: top">
        <td><img src="images/canny/cathedral-debug-green.jpg"/></td>
        <td><img src="images/canny/cathedral-debug-red.jpg"/></td>
        <td><img src="images/canny/monastery-debug-green.jpg"/></td>
        <td><img src="images/canny/monastery-debug-red.jpg"/></td>
    </tr>
</table>
<br>
After looking at this, it wasn't immediately clear why it was still misaligning but I began strongly suspecting the
image borders since it seemed to have the most overlap and the other edges seemed to be missing in the other channel
which could be leading to the prioritization of matching the border edges.

<h2>Gaussian Filter</h2>
In order to further improve on the alignment, I looked for a while to de-emphasize the importance of the image borders.
I reasoned that the photographer likely wanted to capture the subject towards the center of the frame and the debug
images I printed out also seemed to support this conclusion. To do this, I decided to use a simple np mask that was
fitted to a gaussian curve on both axis, scaled to [0, 1]. Running it on the same edge images yielded much more
promising debug outputs:
<br>
<table>
    <tr style="vertical-align: top">
        <td><img src="images/canny-gaussian/cathedral-debug-green.jpg"/></td>
        <td><img src="images/canny-gaussian/cathedral-debug-red.jpg"/></td>
        <td><img src="images/canny-gaussian/monastery-debug-green.jpg"/></td>
        <td><img src="images/canny-gaussian/monastery-debug-red.jpg"/></td>
    </tr>
</table>
<br>
<h2>Bells & Whistles (Auto Contrast)</h2>
In an effort to introduce more contrast into the image, I decided to calculate the overall luminance for each pixel
such that the darkest and brightest color of the image would be stretched to black / white. I effectively used a linear
transformation but it seemed like there wasn't too many obvious effects. In particular, I disregarded the outside 1/8th
of the pixels since I reasoned it had the least impact on the perceived image colors. I feel that it might've been better
to use a curve for transformation but it seems that the images are already well distributed in terms of the luminance
histogram.
<br>
<table class="striped">
    <tr style="vertical-align: top">
        <td><img src="images/auto-contrast/before/church.jpg"/></td>
        <td><img src="images/auto-contrast/after/church.jpg"/></td>
    </tr>
    <tr style="vertical-align: top">
        <td><img src="images/auto-contrast/before/onion_church.jpg"/></td>
        <td><img src="images/auto-contrast/after/onion_church.jpg"/></td>
    </tr>
    <tr style="vertical-align: top">
        <td><img src="images/auto-contrast/before/icon.jpg"/></td>
        <td><img src="images/auto-contrast/after/icon.jpg"/></td>
    </tr>
    <tr style="vertical-align: top">
        <td><img src="images/auto-contrast/before/lady.jpg"/></td>
        <td><img src="images/auto-contrast/after/lady.jpg"/></td>
    </tr>
    <tr style="vertical-align: top">
        <td><img src="images/auto-contrast/before/harvesters.jpg"/></td>
        <td><img src="images/auto-contrast/after/harvesters.jpg"/></td>
    </tr>
</table>
<br>


<h2>Optimizations</h2>
Lastly, this project had a run time requirement and I noticed that towards the during my image pyramid algorithms, it
was very rare for the displacement to become more than 5-8 pixels from the previous displacement found. I reasoned that
this must've been because of the previous scale not being that much further. Therefore, I designed the pyramid algorithm
to use decreasingly smaller displacement search windows. In the end, my runs became about 60-70% faster.
